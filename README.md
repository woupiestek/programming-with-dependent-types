# programming-with-dependent-types
experimenting with applications of dependent type theories.

A dependent type is a type-valued function. Usually, dependent type theories have type operators that turn such 
type-valued functions into function types, for functions whose return type dependents on the argument values.

In math-speak: locally Cartesian closed categories supposedly help software engineers build better software.
